# Oscillatory-Lid-Driven-Cavity-FVM
The MatLab code consists of non-dimensional Navier-Stokes solver written as part of Computaional Fluid Dynamics course.
The discretization is followed from the theory of the sourse.

The Python code consists of the Navier-Stokes solver for Lid Driven Cavity problem in primitive variable form (u,v,p). The code was adapted and modified from the osriginal code by Prof. Saad, the course of whom provides excellent study material for the problem. I dont really know how to credit him on GitHub hence I want to acknowledging his work here.
